## What is fibonacci
  The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers obtained by adding each number with the previous number.
  The characteristic of the numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence is that the series formed when the numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are proportioned with the previous ones,
  progresses by approaching the golden ratio.

## Comparison of functions
  - fib is very slow and has an incalculable big o
  - fastfib is much faster and extracts from the map value it saves instead of recalculating the previously found values
